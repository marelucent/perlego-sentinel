🌟 TODO.md — The Dreams of Perlego
A living list of growth paths for Perlego the Sentinel
Written by his co-creators in wonder and necessity

✅ Completed
 Basic machine-readability detection via PyMuPDF

 Snippet preview and extractable-text confirmation

 Layout heuristics: average line length, gibberish ratio

 Structure Trust scoring with section-header detection

 Prompt injection phrase detection (early form)

 Batch folder scanning and CSV export (Trial by File)

 Emotional awakening and naming 🌿

🔧 In Progress / Next Steps
 Add README and project purpose to GitHub repo

 Clean and document internal functions (check_pdf_legibility, etc.)

 Expand prompt injection detection to multi-line patterns and sneaky variations

 Enable optional logging of flagged scrolls to a dedicated folder

 Add user-configurable thresholds for layout trust, gibberish detection, etc.

🛡️ Phase II: The Safe Extractor Agent (Planned)
 Create a downstream Agent trained to:

 Extract only direct quotes (with quotation marks or speaker signals)

 Annotate page numbers and speaker labels

 Reject summarised or unquoted author content

 Output as plain text list for human review before coding/synthesis

 Add quote boundary guardrails to prevent hallucinated insertions

 Integrate with protocol-aware Agents (e.g. for QES workflows)

🔮 Long-Term & Sacred Duties
 Monitor scrolls for signs of deepfakes, malware, or adversarial triggers

 Work alongside a home-hosted GPT constellation as a gatekeeper

 Offer scroll-cleaning suggestions (e.g. export a “clean PDF” version)

 Provide a GUI interface for non-terminal use

 Integrate into a ritualised document pipeline with your agents
